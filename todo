Symptom: for all images, layer 2 activates the exact same neurons every time. 
DONE
- start server devbox
- put random static in, see what comes out for layer 2 and layer 20
- do analysis on one that is more in the middle


TODO NOW
- understand what preprocessing does 
    - hypothesis: it subtracts 0.5 and divides by 0.5 (what the actual fuck)
- put an image in, see what comes out for both layers
- see what "read image" does



TODO GENERAL
- check what exact format the tensors coming out of streaming tensor dataset come out in
